I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream.
If a dog chews shoes, whose shoes does he choose?
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
Birthdays are good for you. Studies show that people who have the most of them live the longest.
Cooler than the flip side of the pillow.
Does expecting the unexpected make the unexpected, expected?
Shoot for the stars and you might land on the moon.
Snap, crackle, pop.
